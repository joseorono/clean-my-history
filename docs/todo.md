# Clean My History - Project TODO

## 🚀 Current Roadmap

### Critical / High Priority
- [ ] **UI Polish & Consistency**
  - [ ] Standardize view wrappers using `ViewContainer` across all views
  - [ ] Reduce icon-label gap in tabs (Settings tab already icon-only)
  - [ ] Fix any remaining MUI transition/ref issues

### Nice to Have
- [ ] **Enhanced Session Cleaner**
  - [ ] Show preview of tabs to be closed before execution
  - [ ] Add undo functionality for recently closed tabs
  - [ ] Move periodic tab checking to background script for persistence

- [ ] **Browser Cleaner Improvements**
  - [ ] Add time range scoping (last hour/day/week) with preview
  - [ ] Remove debug message UI from production
  - [ ] Better error handling and user feedback

- [ ] **Code Quality & Architecture**
  - [ ] Split `lib/history.ts` into pure functions + React Query hooks
  - [ ] Split `lib/tabs.ts` responsibilities and move mutations to hooks/
  - [ ] Add JSDoc documentation for public functions and hooks
  - [ ] Debounce Redux persistence writes to avoid excessive storage operations

- [ ] **Settings & UX**
  - [ ] Replace `confirm()` dialogs with MUI dialogs
  - [ ] Centralize toast messages in constants/utility module
  - [ ] Review and optimize naming conventions (e.g., `badKeywordCategories`)
